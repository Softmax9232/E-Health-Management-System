# Implementation of Features

# User-Friendly Platform for Medical Treatment:
The e-Health Management System provides a user-friendly platform for medical treatment. The ReactJS
framework is used to build the front-end of the application, ensuring a responsive and intuitive user
interface. The user can easily navigate through different sections of the application, such as viewing
medical records, scheduling appointments, and communicating with healthcare providers.

# RozarPay API Integration:
To facilitate direct payment of hospital bills by insurance companies, the e-Health Management System
integrates the RozarPay API. This integration allows insurance companies to make payments directly
through the system, streamlining the billing and payment process. The API provides secure and reliable
payment processing, ensuring smooth transactions between the system and the insurance companies.

# Real-Time Communication with Chat Engine:
The e-Health Management System incorporates a Chat Engine to enable real-time communication
between healthcare providers and patients. This feature allows users to chat with doctors, nurses, or
other healthcare professionals, eliminating the need for physical visits in certain cases. The Chat Engine
ensures secure and private conversations, enhancing the overall patient experience and reducing
response time for medical queries.

# Efficient Management of Patient Data and Medical Records:
To efficiently manage and retrieve patient data and medical records, the e-Health Management System
utilizes MongoDB, a NoSQL database, and the Mongoose library. Patient information, including
medical history, diagnosis reports, and treatment details, are stored in a structured and organized
manner, ensuring easy access and retrieval. The utilization of MongoDB and Mongoose enables fast and
efficient querying of patient data, providing healthcare providers with the necessary information for
effective decision-making.

# Online Payment Interface for Booking Appointments:
The e-Health Management System includes an online payment interface that allows users to book
appointments directly through the system. Patients can select their preferred healthcare provider, choose
an available time slot, and make the payment securely within the application. This feature eliminates the
need for manual booking and payment processes, enhancing convenience for both patients and
healthcare providers.
