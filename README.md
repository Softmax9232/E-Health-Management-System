# Real-Time Communication with Chat Engine:
The e-Health Management System incorporates a Chat Engine to enable real-time communication
between healthcare providers and patients. This feature allows users to chat with doctors, nurses, or
other healthcare professionals, eliminating the need for physical visits in certain cases. The Chat Engine
ensures secure and private conversations, enhancing the overall patient experience and reducing
response time for medical queries.

# Efficient Management of Patient Data and Medical Records:
To efficiently manage and retrieve patient data and medical records, the e-Health Management System
utilizes MongoDB, a NoSQL database, and the Mongoose library. Patient information, including
medical history, diagnosis reports, and treatment details, are stored in a structured and organized
manner, ensuring easy access and retrieval. The utilization of MongoDB and Mongoose enables fast and
efficient querying of patient data, providing healthcare providers with the necessary information for
effective decision-making.

# Online Payment Interface for Booking Appointments:
The e-Health Management System includes an online payment interface that allows users to book
appointments directly through the system. Patients can select their preferred healthcare provider, choose
an available time slot, and make the payment securely within the application. This feature eliminates the
need for manual booking and payment processes, enhancing convenience for both patients and
healthcare providers.
